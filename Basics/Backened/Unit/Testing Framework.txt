Testing Framework
--------------------
A testing framework is a set of guidelines or rules used for creating and designing test cases. 
It is comprised of a combination of practices and tools that are designed to help QA professionals test more efficiently. 
By using a testing framework, you can increase the accuracy and performance of software testing to high levels. 

Why use a testing framework
Beacuse the testing-process has 6-stages 
1.Prepartion 
2.Provide the inputs
3.Run the test
4.Provide the expected output
5.Verify result
6.Do something to alert the developer if test has failed

The mandaratory stages for any code by developer are Prepartion the test case, Providing the inputs and Providing the expected output.

but rest of the three stages are common to any code by the developer so these stages are handled by Testing Framework.

Why we use Junit5 instead of Junit4?
1.Junit4 > 10 years old
2.Not up to date with newer testing patterns
3.Not up to date with java language features
4.Monolithic architecture (it has only one jar file)
5.Bugs and features requests piled up


Junit5 architecture
----------------------
									Platform(is the core of Junit)it is a test engine
									
				Junit API			Vintage(other set of API)						Extend API
				 Jupiter		It has ability to run older(junit4) tests		You can come up with different API
													
														User
					(he can come up with any of the three API and use test engine(platform))
